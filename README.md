# <p align="center">Adventures in modern C++ by ***lanl2tz***</p>
---
In this repository I aim to jot down :
- Solutions to LeetCode Problems. Specifically ones that I consider to be classic algorithm questions.
- Fragmental stuff that I picked up from modern features of C++ (mainly from C++11 and
its supplementary patches C++14 and C++17).\
I picked up these pieces of modern C++ bits for just two reasons:
- They make writing certain features really easy or efficient.
- Artistry can be derived from the structures implemented using them.
## C++ 17
I'm primarily concerned with C++ 17 as it is well implemented across 
different compilers (Clang, GCC, etc), whereas features in C++ 20 are still in the waiting status for some compilers.
## Compiler
I use the Apple Clang g++ compiler with flag ```-std=c++17```.
## Tests
Currently I plan to write sample header files for each case scenarios and a ```test()``` function along provided for the test driver.
